README
======
Wik is a method of viewing and maintaining collections of text notes.

It takes the form of a single-file web server and wiki, able to prettily present the content of markdown files as if the underlying folder were a wiki structure.  It's designed to be unobtrusive and run atop existing organisation systems to aid management of projects, studies, and other things you might wish to keep notes about.

Note: if you're viewing this in Wik itself, [More information](sample-content/) is available in the sample content's homepage.

Requirements
------------
All requirements are mandatory.

* ruby 1.9 or above, and the gems:

    * markdown
    * mime-types

Using Wik
---------
When launched, Wik displays a web interface on a given port and interface (by default this is `localhost:8080`), where it will display the contents of a folder in a wiki-like way.

To launch Wik and browse this documentation, simply run

    $ ./wik

from the folder with this README file in it, then visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

### Configuration

The default options are designed to be useful in most cases, however, the basic behaviour is somewhat customisable.  When starting, Wik will consider the following config files (each level clobbers those above):
 
 1. `/etc/wikrc`
 2. `~/.wikrc`
 3. Command-line options (use `-h` to list them)

Configuration files should be written in YAML as a hash of key-value pairs.  Configuration files can override more options than are available on the command-line, and they're listed in the (commented) [example config](example.wikrc).

Todo
----
There's a few things that would be useful, but break the single-file philosophy too much.  They may be implemented one day (and if you do any, please send me a patch!):

* SSL support---would make the password-to-edit feature more useful, but requires certificate specification and there's no easy way to roll them into the file:
* Markdown highlighting in browser---Again, hard to inline without sending colossal, overwrought pages.  All Javascript and CSS gracefully degrades, so adding complexity may make that goal harder.

Known Bugs
----------
None (but I didn't look very hard)
